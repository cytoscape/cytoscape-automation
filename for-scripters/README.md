# 2017 CyREST Competition
There were four winners of the 2017 CyREST Competition, all demonstrating solved problems using R and Python combined with Cytoscape Automation.

The winners were:
* [Leandro Lima](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-automation/blob/master/for-scripters/Python/Lima_data_mining_%26_visualization_-_2017_CyREST_Challenge)  (Python)   [teaser](https://www.ime.usp.br/~llima/batb/network.html)
  - Mined skateboarding data and produced simple visualization ... shows data acquisition and basic CyREST usage

* [Mark Grimes](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-automation/tree/master/for-scripters/R/cyrest-challenge-2017-grimes) (R) [teaser](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-automation/blob/master/for-scripters/R/cyrest-challenge-2017-grimes/LINCSRNotebook1.Rmd)
